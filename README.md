# FaceModelling
3D  face reconstruction
This simple project is based on the paper "Efficient 3D reconstruction for face recognition"
Tools  needed:

1.face aligment method ,number of landmerks specified like 66,49 or 33;you should take which landmark system according to the 3D model you use.

2.face detection method

3.MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : FaceModeling Project
